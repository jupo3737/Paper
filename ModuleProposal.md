JavaScript Modification Proposal
================================

Members: Justin Powell, James Ontiveros, Tom Spooner

Overview:
---------
When looking at JavaScript and what it has to offer, some may wonder what would make it easier. One answer to that question is to add modules into the language and simplify them for easy use. Modules would allow reuse of advantageous code throughout a project.

Modules are similar to objects, but they must be explicitly exported in order to be externally visible. Modules can either be defined as inline or as external files, which allow for use of blocks of code that will be utilized throughout the project. This is very useful if one is looking for an external widget that they want to incorporate into their project. 

```JavaScript
	module Car{
		// import code
		// export code
	}
```

This simple example shows the structure of a module. At the top of the module you have all of the variable and function imports, and at the bottom you have all of the functions and variables that you can export into different programs and even modules.

Module *instances* are modules which have been evaluated, linked to other modules, or holds lexically encapsulated data. Here is an example of a module instance:
	
```JavaScript
	module myCar at "car.js"
```

You can also declare modules in the following way:

```JavaScript
	module UniverseTest {};
	module Universe { module MilkyWay {} };
	module MilkyWay = 'Universe/MilkyWay';
	module SolarSystem = Universe.MilkyWay.SolarSystem;
	module MySystem = SolarSystem;
```

History of Modules:
-------------------
Modules appeared in JavaScript back in 2008 with Gecko 1.9. Gecko is an open source layout engine that was commonly used for Mozilla. When modules were first introduced they were very crude and difficult to follow. Since 2008 there has been no significant changes to modules in JavaScript, even though they have been proven to be extremely powerful tools in other programming languages. The new proposal for modules in ES.next looks very refined and powerful.

Exporting and Importing:
------------------------
Any `export` declaration makes functions and variables visible to other modules. This obviously makes modules very useful when creating a project. It's basically like a class in Java or C++ with public and private variables. The programmer can choose what to export from his/her module, which is a powerful tool. Here is an example of some exporting:

```JavaScript
	module Car {
	  	// Internal
	  	var licensePlateNo = '556-343';
	  	// External
	  	export function drive(speed, direction) {
	    	console.log('details:', speed, direction);
	  	}
	  	export module engine{
	  	  export function check() { }
	  	}
	  	export var miles = 5000;
	  	export var color = 'silver';
	};
```
A programmer can `import` variables and other functions from another module that he/she wants to utilize. This can be seen above with the `export` declaration in the `Car` module. A programmer may import the function `drive()` or `check()`, or he/she can import the variables `miles` or `color`. Even though a programmer can import these functions or variables, he/she cannot redefine them. (Exports can be renamed to distinguish them from other local variables)

A programmer may also choose what they want to import from certain modules so that they don't need to import the entire thing. This is very useful if the programmer only wants one function or variable from a module. Even with a few variables or functions it would be smart to not import the entire module if one will not utilize all of its content.

Import `drive()` from car.

```JavaScript
		import drive from Car;
```

Import `drive()` and `miles` from car.

```javascript
		import {drive, miles} from Car;
```

Modules are very diverse in what they allow us to do. We can `import` what we need or `export` functions that will come in handy later. They are useful blocks of code that are accessed with a single line of code. This makes writing concise code easier and quicker. A programmer can have their modules be the backbone of a project, he/she can then import everything that they need from the modules and the project will be quickly underway. Open source modules will also help other developers with their projects if they can't be bothered to write their own functions. `Importing` and `exporting` modules will save a lot of time and code in the long run.

Module Loader API:
------------------
ES.next states that it aims to develop a "dynamic, reflective API for loading module scripts in controlled and selective contexts." Each host environment comes with a built-in system where users can create custom loaders using the Loader constructor. Some of the goals listed by ES.next in providing this loading functionality include providing dynamic loading, nested virtualization and state isolation. 

The functionality is similar to that of import, in that it can consume anything defined as an export from a separate module, like below:
```JavaScript
	// Signature: load(moduleURL, callback, errorCallback)
	Loader.load('car.js', function(car) {
  	  console.log(car.drive(500, 'north'));
	}, function(err) {
  	  console.log('Error:' + err);
	});
```
And another:
```javascript
Loader.load('http://json.org/modules/json2.js',
    function(JSON) {
        alert(JSON.stringify([0, {a: true}]));
    });
```

load() has 3 arguements, being:

* moduleURL: The address of a module to taken in, in the case above, this is car.js
* callback: A callback function which receives the output result of attempting to load, compile and then execute the module
* errorCallback: A callback triggered if an error occurs during compilation


Classes:
--------
The changes being made in ES.next to add class functionality are mostly to simplify readability, in which code becomes easier and faster to write and comprehend. Below is an example comparing code written for ES.next, compared to code written for modern day JavaScript:

```javascript
   module widgets {
  	// ...
 
     export class DropDownButton extends Widget {
       constructor(attributes) {
      	    super(attributes);
      	    this.buildUI();
       }
 
       buildUI() {
         this.domNode.onclick = (e) -> {
        	// ...
       	 };
       }
    }
  }
```

And in today's javascript:

```javascript
var widgets = (function(global) {
  // ...
 
  function DropDownButton(attributes) {
    Widget.call(this, attributes);
    this.buildUI();
  }
 
  DropDownButton.prototype = Object.create(Widget.prototype, {
    constructor: { value: DropDownButton },
    buildUI:     {
      value: function(e) {
        this.domNode.onclick = function(e) {
          // ...
        }
      }
    }
  });
})(this);
```

As we can see, classes are syntactic sugar for function in the current release of JavaScript. The benefit of class functionality is to reduce complexity of code, and make it easier to read.

Modules in Web Development
--------------------------
Modules will come in handy for web development. They will be able to hold classes the build UI widgets, like the example above, so that a web developer can import which classes they want to use or they can add more. This will cut down on file use for separate UI widgets which is always a good thing in web development. A front end developer would be glad to have a widget module that contains a bunch of UI classes that control how objects on a web page react. Modules like this will make scripts on HTML pages more clean and concise, which will help load times as well.

The Proposal:
-------------
Overall, the goals set forth in module functionality in ES.next include providing faster compilation, easy external loading, and above all increasing simplicity and usability. 
This reasoning in itself provides the justification for including modules in the development of JavaScript. By implementing the new modules JavaScript will be modernized and up to speed with the other leading languages.
Well-written modules have the advantage of making code more scalable. That is, when designed well, modules can work independently of each other, and can be added or removed efficiently. This has the benefit of making collaboration much easier, as developers can be assigned with the task of designing certain modules independent of one another, and only has to worry about minimal conflicts. The individual can utilize coding styles or preferences, and there is no conflict when they are brought together, hindering the coding process. By utilizing module templates web designers will be able to collaborate to achieve unique and well-developed UI widgets such as drop down menus, and picture sliders.
